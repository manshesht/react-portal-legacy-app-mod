# react-portal-legacy-app-mod
React Portals concept to demonstrate how to use portals to modify applications that have already been built.

This program demonstrates the ability to modify older applications with React even if they were not already made in react through the use of Portals. In this application, I use Portals to create tooltips to help navigate a simple site that has been coded in HTML.
